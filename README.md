# jinja2-network-automation-guide
Welcome to your first network automation repository.

This project teaches network engineers (with zero automation experience) how to use:

Jinja2 templates

YAML + CSV data

Python (rendering script)

Custom filters + tests

Vendor-specific templates (NX-OS, EOS, FortiGate)

…to generate clean, deterministic network configurations automatically.

Whether you are learning automation or using this for real DC deployments (VXLAN EVPN), this guide walks you through every concept in simple language.
